# speech-to-text-transcriber
Built a web app using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3 to let users upload or record audio and receive multilingual transcriptions. HTML structured the UI, JS handled recording and backend communication, and CSS styled the interface. Entirely browser-based and cloud-integrated.
